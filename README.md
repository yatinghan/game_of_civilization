## Running the Game <a name="running_the_game"></a>

## Project Proposal <a name="project_proposal"></a>

### Project Summary
We are going to implement an enhanced version of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life, i.e. Game of Civilization, on GPU, to simulate the evolution of lives, villages, cities and nations.  

### Background
In the original Game of Life, the status of every cell in the world follows a simple set of rules:
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
